# DailyScrum

Hey there :wave:

Welcome to my workplace! You will see some things and may even learn an item or :v:

You can perform a daily scrum in many ways.

Here, I will use the triple **P** method; **P**rogress, **P**lans, and **P**roblems. 

1. **Progress** is where I list work that is "done" from the previous day.

2. **Plans** are the things that I need to get done before the next scrum.

3. **Problems** are challenges encountered during the progress from the previous work session.

Soon, this band of misfits will make their way on the blog: [Agile 365 Development](https://www.arkuscloud.io).
